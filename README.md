# Science Museum Group Collection Chrome Extension

Loads a random object with an image from the [Science Museum Group Collection](https://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk) each time you open a new tab in the Chrome browser. 

The Chrome extension files are in the [docs folder](https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/collection-chrome-extension/tree/master/docs). Correctly sized images for the Chrome Store are in the [chrome-store-promo-images folder](https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/collection-chrome-extension/tree/master/chrome-store-promo-images)

View a [preview of the page](https://thesciencemuseum.github.io/collection-chrome-extension/index.html) rendered by the extension in each new tab.

[Download the zip file](https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/collection-chrome-extension/blob/master/smg-col-chrome-extension.zip) to test on Chrome ahead of launch on Chrome Store.
