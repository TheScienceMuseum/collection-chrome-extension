# Science Museum Group Collection Chrome Extension

Loads a random object with an image from the [Science Museum Group Collection] (https://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk) each time you open a new tab in the Chrome browser. 

The Chrome extension files are in the [docs folder] (https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/collection-chrome-extension/tree/master/docs).

View a [preview of the page] (https://thesciencemuseum.github.io/collection-chrome-extension/index.html) rendered by the extension in each new tab.
